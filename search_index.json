The book is composed of four chapters. The first chapter introduces “open” definition and open data principles and lists various open data platforms within several domains and data types. In chapter 2, we focus on world kpi related data by presenting main sources and some analysis. Tn chapter 3, we present open data provided in European scale. The last chapter presents open data platform provided in French scale. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Open Definition 2.2 Open-source applications 2.3 Open data", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Open Definition The Open Knwoledge Foundation proposed an open definition by setting out principles that define “openness” in relation to data and content. It can be summed up in the statement that: “Open means anyone can freely accesss, use, modify, and share for any purpose”. We can find the full open definition here. We can summarize the most important elements of “openness” with: The availability and access The re-use and redistribution The Universal participation Interoperability remains very important consideration in open data and contens. It denotes th ability of different systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate). 2.2 Open-source applications We can find applications of open-source movement in various domains: Software development: A descentralized software development model based on open collaboration. The source code of these softwares is publicly available and they are under an open-source licnese. Examples: Mozilla Firefox, Hadoop, Linux, Git, Elasticsearch, Spark, Dcker, MongoDB… Government: Giving the citizens access to governments’ documents by developing and sharing open data plateforms Knowledge and contents: It is knowledge that everyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute without legal, social or technological restriction. It ensures that content remains free for re-use, that source documents are available to interested parties, and that changes to content are accepted. Examples: wikipedia, Project Gutenberg (A digital library of free e-books), Wikisource (an online digital library of free-content textual sources on a wiki, operated by the Wikimedia Foundation), Openstreetmap…. Science: It consists of making scientific research (publications, data, tools…) acessible to public. Examples: The Dataverse Network Project, arXiv (open-access repository of scientific papers)… Education: A shared web space as a platform to improve upon learning, organizational, and management challenges. Examples: Openclassoom, wikiversity… 2.3 Open data 2.3.1 Open data in institutional services Open data refers to making data freely available to evryone to use and republish without restrictions. These data are provided in different way: via APIs, by downloading datasets and databases… Nowadays we notice the increasing number of plateforms and services sharing open data in different domains and scales. Here is a list of some examples of these services: International organizations: The World Bank’s Open Data initiative provides all users with open access to World Bank data, the world Helath Observatory provides indicators and statistcs via free databases, earth data provided from NASA… Goverment data: Several govrnments developed web platefroms for exploring and accessing open data related to economy, agriculture, society, culture… For examples: French data gov, US data gov… European Orgnisations: EUropean commission invested on the The European Union Open data portal, Eurostat 2.3.2 Open data for machine learning The increasing development of machine learning models participated to the explosion of labeled data ready to use fir training machine learning and deep learning models for different tasks: image classification, object detection, natural language processing (sentitment analysis, translation…), speech recognition… We can find various plateforms providing access to these datasets including the descritpion and scripts used for developing and training existing models.

Its mission is to provide high quality statistics for Europe. Those statistics enable comparisons between countries and regions. It may help decision makers in different levels (EU level, local governement, businesses…) in addition to public and media use. Eurostat offers a whole range of important and interesting data concerning different thematics: population and society, helath, transport, economy and finance… The main role of Eurostat is to process and publish statistical information at European level by defining common methods, concepts, structures and technical standards. Eurostat does not collect data. The data collection is done in Member States by their statistical authorities. The role of Eurostat is to consolidate the data and ensure they are comparable and harmonized. Eurostat is the only provider of statistics and harmonized data at European level. Data accessibility: The different statistics are available in Eurostat database with some visualisation tools. Eurostat’ss datasets are updated twice a day and can be loaded by bulk donwload or via web services. Matadata: The different definitions, classifications, methologies, codes are provided within metadat sections Data quality: Eurostat ensures data quality based on a Quality assurance framework build for European statistical system.

To download only a small section of the dataset the JSON API is faster, as it allows to make a data selection before downloading. Here an example of indicator ‘Modal split of passenger transport’. This is the percentage share of each mode of transport in total inland transport, expressed in passenger-kilometres (pkm) based on transport by passenger cars, buses and coaches, and trains. All data should be based on movements on national territory, regardless of the nationality of the vehicle. However, the data collection is not harmonized at the EU level.

Using each gas’ individual global warming potential (GWP), they are being integrated into a single indicator expressed in units of CO2 equivalents.

Ce mouvement a été accéléré avec la promulgation de la loi République Numérique qui incite les différentes collectivités locales (communes, EPCI, départements et régions) à publier leurs données. Pour celà, ils ont été accompagnés par plusieurs dispositifs publics (OpenDataLocale, Vlidata…) ainsi qu’une implication du secteur privé en matière de conseil, formation, mise à disposition de plateformes de publication et d’exploitation… Cette politique d’ouverture des données est pilotée par la mission Etalab Rapport intéressant: https://datactivist.coop/ardeche/rapport/partie1.html 5.1 Opendata france Opendata Frace est une association créée en 2013 à Toulouse et a pour but de regrouper et soutenir les collectivités engagés activement dans une démarche d’ouverture des données publiques. Les actions de cette association consistent en: - Accompagner et aider les collectivités à lancer ou dévélopper leurs projets opendata - Animer des rencontres ou des ateliers permettant aux participants de progrsser dans leur démarche d’ouverture des données - Communiquer autour de l’opendata 5.2 Opendata locale Opendata France a été missionnée pour soutenir les petites et moyennes communes dans leur démarche d’ouvertue des données dans le cadre du projet Opendata Locale. Ceci a permis de produire des supports méthodologiques, pédagogiques et techniques qui permettent d’assurer la mutualisation des connaissances et l’harmonisation et normalisation des données. 5.3 Observatoire de l’Opendata OpendataFrance a mis en place un observatoire de l’open data dans les territoires pour connaitre et comprendre l’avancement dees démarches d’ouverture des données publiques dans les territoires: http://www.observatoire-opendata.fr/ Les données sont collectées majoritairement de manière automatique. L’observatoire propose aussi des indicateurs qui permettent de quantifier et qualifier l’opendata publiée. Il permet ainsi d’évaluer en continu l’ouverture des données dans les collectivités territoriales. Il produit des restitutions sous diférents formats: documents de synthèse eta analyse, outils de visualisation interactive et les bases de données brutes. Ce projet a été élaboré en partenariat avec la Caisse des Dépôts et Etalab. 5.4 Etalab Etalab Fait partie de la Direction interministérielle du numérique de l’Etat. Sa mission consiste en la coordination, la conception et mise en oeuvre de la stratégie de l’état dans le domaine de la donnée. Il coordonne la politique d’ouverture et de partage des données publiques. Il développe et anime la plateforme d’open data data.gouv.fr destinée à rassembler et à mettre à disposition librement l’ensemble des informations publiques de l’Etat, de ses établissments publics, les collectivités territoriales… Etalab contribue ) la promotion des sciences des données et de l’intelligence artificielle dans la sphère publique.
