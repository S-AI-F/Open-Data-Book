It can be summed up with the following statement : “Open means anyone can freely accesss, use, modify, and share for any purpose”. We can find the full open definition here. We can summarize the most important elements of “openness” with: The availability and access The re-use and redistribution The Universal participation Interoperability remains very important consideration in open data and contens. It denotes th ability of different systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate). 2.2 Open-source applications We can find applications of open-source movement in various domains: Software development: A descentralized software development model based on open collaboration. The source code of these softwares is publicly available and they are under an open-source licnese. Examples: Mozilla Firefox, Hadoop, Linux, Git, Elasticsearch, Spark, Docker, MongoDB… Government: Giving the citizens access to governments’ documents by developing and sharing open data plateforms Knowledge and contents: It is knowledge that everyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute without legal, social or technological restriction. It ensures that content remains free for re-use, that source documents are available to interested persons, and that changes to content are accepted. Examples: wikipedia, Project Gutenberg (A digital library of free e-books), Wikisource (an online digital library of free-content textual sources on a wiki, operated by the Wikimedia Foundation), Openstreetmap…. Science: It consists of making scientific research (publications, data, tools…) acessible to public. Examples: The Dataverse Network Project, arXiv (open-access repository of scientific papers)… Education: A shared web space as a platform to improve upon learning, organizational, and management challenges. Examples: Openclassoom, wikiversity… 2.3 Open data 2.3.1 Open data in institutional services Open data refers to making data freely available to everyone to use and republish without restrictions. These data are provided in different way: via APIs, by downloading datasets and databases… Nowadays we notice the increasing number of plateforms and services sharing open data in different domains and scales. Here is a list of some examples of these services: International organizations: The World Bank’s Open Data initiative provides all users with open access to World Bank data, the world Helath Observatory provides indicators and statistcs via free databases, earth data provided from NASA… Goverment data: Several govrnments developed web platefroms for exploring and accessing open data related to economy, agriculture, society, culture… For examples: French data gov, US data gov… European Orgnisations: EUropean commission invested on the The European Union Open data portal, Eurostat 2.3.2 Open data for machine learning The increasing development of machine learning models participated to the explosion of labeled data ready to use for training machine learning and deep learning models for different tasks: image classification, object detection, natural language processing (sentitment analysis, translation…), speech recognition… We can find various plateforms providing access to these datasets including the descritpion and scripts used for developing and training existing models: Kaggle datasets UCI Machine Learning Repository Amazon datasets Microsoft datasets Computer vision datasets OpenML Google Dataset Search In the folowing sections, we list some famous open datasets used for developing machine learning models. 2.3.2.1 Image data Tasks Name Description Link Character recognition MNIST It’s a dataset of handwritten digits and contains a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

Data related to remote sensing, specifically satellite images, have a purpose to observe and study the Earth from space; its land surface, the oceans and the atmosphere. Earth observation data can be acquired through different public and private channels. Free of cost data is generally provided by public agencies. Here is a list of the main providers of open earth observation data: European Space Agency (ESA): The European Space Agency is an intergovernmental organisation dedicated to the exploration of space. It manages Copernicus Earth Observation program that aims at chieving a global, continuous, autonomous, high quality, wide range Earth observation capacity. The data and information produced in the framework Copernicus are made available free-to-charge all its users and the public. The ESA different provides tools to download, visualize and process earth observation data. Sentinel open Access Hub United States Geological Survey (USGS): The USGS is a scientific agency of the United STates government studying the the landscape of the United States, its natural resources, and the natural hazards that threaten it. It operates the landsat program with the NASA. Landsat is the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth. Landsat data products held in the USGS archives can be searched and downloaded at no charge from a variety of sources National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): The NASA is an independant agency of the United States Federal Government responsible for the civilian space program. NASA promotes the full and open sharing of all its data to research and applications communities, private industry, academia, and the general public by the mean of their Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). They provide different tools and products for seraching, using and visualizing remote sensing data: Earthdata Search Global Imagery Browse Services Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS WorldView Open NASA Here is an example of visualizing downloaded Landsat data: library(raster) library(rgdal) # Blue b2 &lt;- raster(&#39;data/rs/LC08_044034_20170614_B2.tif&#39;) # Green b3 &lt;- raster(&#39;data/rs/LC08_044034_20170614_B3.tif&#39;) # Red b4 &lt;- raster(&#39;data/rs/LC08_044034_20170614_B4.tif&#39;) # Near Infrared (NIR) b5 &lt;- raster(&#39;data/rs/LC08_044034_20170614_B5.tif&#39;) landsatRGB &lt;- stack(b4, b3, b2) plotRGB(landsatRGB, axes = TRUE, stretch = &quot;lin&quot;, main = &quot;Landsat True Color Composite&quot;) 3.1.7 Other resources In addition to the previously cited organisations and services , plenty of other initiatives and services are providing and promoting the collection and usage of open data in a world wide scale. Our World in data: Our World in data is a collaborative project developed by reserachers at the University of Oxford and the non profit organization “Global Exhange Data Lab” to publish open data and statistics covering various world developement indicators. The website contains different articles based on open data and describing topics like: health, demographic change, food, agriuculture, energy, environment… Global CO2 emissions by world region since 1750 (Our World In Data) Open knowledge FOundation (OKF): Open knowledge FOundation is a global, non-profit network that promotes and shares information at no charge, including both content and data. Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN): Open knowledge FOundation maintains the COmprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) which is an open- source open data portal for the storage and distribution of open data. CKAN is used by differentnational and local governments such as: US data gov, european data portal, open data swiss, canadian data gov… Once the data is published, users can use its faceted search features to browse and find the data they need, and preview it using maps, graphs and tables – whether they are developers, journalists, researchers, NGOs, citizens, or even your own staff.

Examples of data provides: European Central Bank, Eurostat, Internationa Monetary Fund, International Labour Organization, WOrld Bank… 3.2 Tools 3.2.1 Extracting World Bank Data There are different R and Python libraries providing access to World Bank data. We will test two of them in this chapter: WDI and Wbstats. 3.2.1.1 WDI Maternal mortality ratio The WDI library provides easy access to the WorldBank open data. We can use the command WDIsearch for looking up an indicator. library(WDI) WDIsearch(string = &quot;maternal mortality ratio&quot;, field = &quot;name&quot;, short = FALSE) ## indicator ## [1,] &quot;SH.STA.MMRT.NE&quot; ## [2,] &quot;SH.STA.MMRT&quot; ## name ## [1,] &quot;Maternal mortality ratio (national estimate, per 100,000 live births)&quot; ## [2,] &quot;Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births)&quot; ## description ## [1,] &quot;Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births.&quot; ## [2,] &quot;Maternal mortality ratio is the number of women who die from pregnancy-related causes while pregnant or within 42 days of pregnancy termination per 100,000 live births. The data are estimated with a regression model using information on the proportion of maternal deaths among non-AIDS deaths in women ages 15-49, fertility, birth attendants, and GDP.&quot; ## sourceDatabase ## [1,] &quot;World Development Indicators&quot; ## [2,] &quot;World Development Indicators&quot; ## sourceOrganization ## [1,] &quot;UNICEF, State of the World&#39;s Children, Childinfo, and Demographic and Health Surveys.&quot; ## [2,] &quot;WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations Population Division.

DBnomics covers hundreds of millions of series from international and national institutions (Eurostat, World Bank, IMF, …). We will use in this section the rdbnomics which is an R package providing access to DBnomics data series. In order to get dbnomics data we have to specify a serie identifier (ids) defined by three values formatted in this way: provider_code/dataset_code/series/code. We can find these infrmation in the DBnomics and DBnomics API documentation. Here is an example of fetching unemployemet rate dataset (called ZUTN) from the AMECO provider. library(rdbnomics) library(data.table) library(magrittr) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) # get two series of unemployement rate data (europe and danemark) df = rdb(ids = c(&#39;AMECO/ZUTN/EA19.1.0.0.0.ZUTN&#39;, &#39;AMECO/ZUTN/DNK.1.0.0.0.ZUTN&#39;)) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(value)) head(df) ## @frequency Country dataset_code ## 1 annual Euro area ZUTN ## 2 annual Euro area ZUTN ## 3 annual Euro area ZUTN ## 4 annual Euro area ZUTN ## 5 annual Euro area ZUTN ## 6 annual Euro area ZUTN ## dataset_name freq Frequency ## 1 Unemployment rate: total :- Member States: definition EUROSTAT a Annually ## 2 Unemployment rate: total :- Member States: definition EUROSTAT a Annually ## 3 Unemployment rate: total :- Member States: definition EUROSTAT a Annually ## 4 Unemployment rate: total :- Member States: definition EUROSTAT a Annually ## 5 Unemployment rate: total :- Member States: definition EUROSTAT a Annually ## 6 Unemployment rate: total :- Member States: definition EUROSTAT a Annually ## geo indexed_at original_period original_value period ## 1 ea19 2020-05-07 08:46:14 1997 11.5 1997-01-01 ## 2 ea19 2020-05-07 08:46:14 1998 11 1998-01-01 ## 3 ea19 2020-05-07 08:46:14 1999 10.2 1999-01-01 ## 4 ea19 2020-05-07 08:46:14 2000 9.2 2000-01-01 ## 5 ea19 2020-05-07 08:46:14 2001 8.4 2001-01-01 ## 6 ea19 2020-05-07 08:46:14 2002 8.6 2002-01-01 ## provider_code series_code ## 1 AMECO EA19.1.0.0.0.ZUTN ## 2 AMECO EA19.1.0.0.0.ZUTN ## 3 AMECO EA19.1.0.0.0.ZUTN ## 4 AMECO EA19.1.0.0.0.ZUTN ## 5 AMECO EA19.1.0.0.0.ZUTN ## 6 AMECO EA19.1.0.0.0.ZUTN ## series_name ## 1 Annually – (Percentage of active population) – Euro area ## 2 Annually – (Percentage of active population) – Euro area ## 3 Annually – (Percentage of active population) – Euro area ## 4 Annually – (Percentage of active population) – Euro area ## 5 Annually – (Percentage of active population) – Euro area ## 6 Annually – (Percentage of active population) – Euro area ## unit Unit value ## 1 percentage-of-active-population (Percentage of active population) 11.5 ## 2 percentage-of-active-population (Percentage of active population) 11.0 ## 3 percentage-of-active-population (Percentage of active population) 10.2 ## 4 percentage-of-active-population (Percentage of active population) 9.2 ## 5 percentage-of-active-population (Percentage of active population) 8.4 ## 6 percentage-of-active-population (Percentage of active population) 8.6 # plot ggplot(df, aes(x = period, y = value, color = series_name)) + geom_line(size = 1.2) + geom_point(size = 2) + dbnomics() There is another way to get time series by using code mask notation.

Its mission is to provide high quality statistics for Europe. Those statistics enable comparisons between countries and regions. It may help decision makers in different levels (EU level, local governement, businesses…) in addition to public and media use. Eurostat offers a whole range of important and interesting data concerning different thematics: population and society, helath, transport, economy and finance… The main role of Eurostat is to process and publish statistical information at European level by defining common methods, concepts, structures and technical standards. Eurostat does not collect data. The data collection is done in Member States by their statistical authorities. The role of Eurostat is to consolidate the data and ensure they are comparable and harmonized. Eurostat is the only provider of statistics and harmonized data at European level. Data accessibility: The different statistics are available in Eurostat database with some visualisation tools. Eurostat’ss datasets are updated twice a day and can be loaded by bulk donwload or via web services. Matadata: The different definitions, classifications, methologies, codes are provided within metadat sections Data quality: Eurostat ensures data quality based on a Quality assurance framework build for European statistical system. Geographical data: Within Eurostat, GISCO (Geographical Information System of the COmmision) is reposnible for geographical information levels: European Union, its member countries, and its regions (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/statistics-illustrated).

It provides various fonctionaities: data search, download, manipulation and visualization. The package homepageis: http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/ 4.3.1 Finding data The function get_eurostat_toc() downloads a table of contents of eurostat datasets. The values in column ‘code’ should be used to download a selected dataset. # Load the package library(eurostat) library(rvest) ## Loading required package: xml2 # Get Eurostat data listing toc &lt;- get_eurostat_toc() # Check the first items library(knitr) kable(head(toc)) title code type last update of data last table structure change data start data end values Database by themes data folder NA NA NA NA NA General and regional statistics general folder NA NA NA NA NA European and national indicators for short-term analysis euroind folder NA NA NA NA NA Business and consumer surveys (source: DG ECFIN) ei_bcs folder NA NA NA NA NA Consumer surveys (source: DG ECFIN) ei_bcs_cs folder NA NA NA NA NA Consumers - monthly data ei_bsco_m dataset 28.05.2020 28.05.2020 1980M01 2020M05 NA The function search_eurostat can be used to search the table of contents for specifc text pattern.

To download only a small section of the dataset the JSON API is faster, as it allows to make a data selection before downloading. Here an example of indicator ‘Modal split of passenger transport’. This is the percentage share of each mode of transport in total inland transport, expressed in passenger-kilometres (pkm) based on transport by passenger cars, buses and coaches, and trains. All data should be based on movements on national territory, regardless of the nationality of the vehicle. However, the data collection is not harmonized at the EU level.

Using each gas’ individual global warming potential (GWP), they are being integrated into a single indicator expressed in units of CO2 equivalents.

["france-open-data.html", "Chapter 5 France Open data 5.1 Opendata france 5.2 Opendata locale 5.3 Observatoire de l’Opendata 5.4 Etalab", " Chapter 5 France Open data Les démarches d’open data se développent de plus en plus vite au niveau des collectivités. Ce mouvement a été accéléré avec la promulgation de la loi République Numérique qui incite les différentes collectivités locales (communes, EPCI, départements et régions) à publier leurs données. Pour celà, ils ont été accompagnés par plusieurs dispositifs publics (OpenDataLocale, Vlidata…) ainsi qu’une implication du secteur privé en matière de conseil, formation, mise à disposition de plateformes de publication et d’exploitation… Cette politique d’ouverture des données est pilotée par la mission Etalab Rapport intéressant: https://datactivist.coop/ardeche/rapport/partie1.html 5.1 Opendata france Opendata Frace est une association créée en 2013 à Toulouse et a pour but de regrouper et soutenir les collectivités engagés activement dans une démarche d’ouverture des données publiques. Les actions de cette association consistent en: - Accompagner et aider les collectivités à lancer ou dévélopper leurs projets opendata - Animer des rencontres ou des ateliers permettant aux participants de progrsser dans leur démarche d’ouverture des données - Communiquer autour de l’opendata 5.2 Opendata locale Opendata France a été missionnée pour soutenir les petites et moyennes communes dans leur démarche d’ouvertue des données dans le cadre du projet Opendata Locale. Ceci a permis de produire des supports méthodologiques, pédagogiques et techniques qui permettent d’assurer la mutualisation des connaissances et l’harmonisation et normalisation des données. 5.3 Observatoire de l’Opendata OpendataFrance a mis en place un observatoire de l’open data dans les territoires pour connaitre et comprendre l’avancement dees démarches d’ouverture des données publiques dans les territoires: http://www.observatoire-opendata.fr/ Les données sont collectées majoritairement de manière automatique. L’observatoire propose aussi des indicateurs qui permettent de quantifier et qualifier l’opendata publiée. Il permet ainsi d’évaluer en continu l’ouverture des données dans les collectivités territoriales. Il produit des restitutions sous diférents formats: documents de synthèse eta analyse, outils de visualisation interactive et les bases de données brutes. Ce projet a été élaboré en partenariat avec la Caisse des Dépôts et Etalab. 5.4 Etalab Etalab Fait partie de la Direction interministérielle du numérique de l’Etat. Sa mission consiste en la coordination, la conception et mise en oeuvre de la stratégie de l’état dans le domaine de la donnée. Il coordonne la politique d’ouverture et de partage des données publiques. Il développe et anime la plateforme d’open data data.gouv.fr destinée à rassembler et à mettre à disposition librement l’ensemble des informations publiques de l’Etat, de ses établissments publics, les collectivités territoriales… Etalab contribue ) la promotion des sciences des données et de l’intelligence artificielle dans la sphère publique.
